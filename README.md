Stock Control App. Using WPF, MVVM, Entity FrameworkCore.

The app was built with the .NET 6.0 Framework. 

Features
MVVM Design Pattern: The application follows the MVVM design pattern, separating concerns between the Model, View, and ViewModel components. This allows for better code organization, maintainability, and testability.

Entity Framework Core: Entity Framework Core is used for data access and database management. It provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) approach to interact with the underlying database, making it easier to perform CRUD operations and manage entities.

User Interface: The application utilizes the WPF framework to create a user-friendly interface, enabling users to interact with the application's features seamlessly.

Ongoing Feature: The application requires some more validation and tests.
